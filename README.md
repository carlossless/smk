# SMK - Small (device) Mechanical Keyboard Firmware

[![Build](https://github.com/carlossless/smk/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/carlossless/smk/actions/workflows/build.yml) [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-SMK-blue)](https://discord.gg/SZFBDBuxrK)

This is a keyboard firmware targeting SinoWealth 8051-based devices.

The S (Small) in SMK comes from this firmware using [SDCC](https://sdcc.sourceforge.net/) to build itself.

## ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️

This firmware is still highly experimental, so be cautious when trying to use it or extend it.

You can very easily end up with a bricked device if the written firmware can't jump back into ISP mode, so before testing or modifying it, it's best to have a full dump of your stock firmware and a programming tool (like an Arduino Nano + [sinodude-serial](https://github.com/carlossless/sinodude/tree/main/firmware) or SinoWealth SinoLink + ProWriter) that can write it back.

## Supported Devices

Platform notes: [SH68F90 / SH68F90A](docs/platforms/sh68f90.md), [SH68F881](docs/platforms/sh68f881.md), [SH68F89](docs/platforms/sh68f89.md).

## Developing

### Prerequisites

#### Nix

Currently, this project is primarily developed with the help of [Nix](https://nixos.org/) and Nix flakes. Please consider using Nix and the provided [flake](https://github.com/carlossless/smk/blob/master/flake.nix) to automatically set up a reproducible development environment.

With Nix installed and flakes enabled, use `nix develop` or [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to enter a shell with all prerequisites installed.

### Building & Flashing

Once all prerequisites are set up, you can build and flash firmware for a specific combination of keyboard and layout using the following commands:

```sh
meson setup build # configure meson build dir
meson compile -C build nuphy-air60_default_smk.hex # build firmware for nuphy-air60 with the default layout
meson compile -C build nuphy-air60_default_flash # write firmware to the device via sinowisp
```

### Debug Console

Debug builds ship their log output as HID reports. `smk-console` ([tools/smk-console](tools/smk-console)) prints them, and runs on Linux, macOS and Windows:

```sh
cargo run --release --manifest-path tools/smk-console/Cargo.toml               # defaults to 05ac:024f (nuphy-air60)
cargo run --release --manifest-path tools/smk-console/Cargo.toml -- 258a:002a  # eyooso-z11
cargo run --release --manifest-path tools/smk-console/Cargo.toml -- 258a:001f  # genesis-thor-300
cargo run --release --manifest-path tools/smk-console/Cargo.toml -- 258a:0016  # ciy-x77
```

It picks devices up and drops them as they are plugged and unplugged, so it can be left running across a reflash. On Linux the `/dev/hidraw*` node needs a udev rule, or `sudo`.
